 * Calculates tax for the provided line items.

 * Tax is calculated for each line item based on the tax region
 * that corresponds to the address provided in `lineItems.addressIndex` and the tax group in `taxGroupId`. If no tax region is found for
 * the line item's address then no tax will be calculated for this line item. If no tax group with that `taxGroupId` is found then the
 * default tax group is used to calculate tax. Call List Default Tax Groups to retrieve a site's default tax groups.
 *
 * The tax is calculated by a tax calculator app installed on the site.
 * Call List Tax Calculators to see which tax calculators are available.
 * To provide your own tax calculations, use the Tax Calculation service plugin.
 *
 * The breakdown of calculated tax returned, includes:
 * + `taxSummary`: The overall total tax calculated.
 * + `taxSummary.aggregatedTaxBreakdown`: The total tax calculated for each jurisdiction.
 * + `lineItemTaxDetails.taxSummary`: The total tax calculated for each line item.
 * + `lineItemTaxDetails.taxBreakdown`: The tax calculated for each line item in each jurisdiction.
