 *
 * Retrieves a list of bookings, given the provided paging, filtering, and sorting.
 *
 *
 * You can also retrieve information about which actions the customer can perform
 * for the bookings. To do so, pass `withBookingAllowedActions` as `true`.
 *
 * Query Bookings runs with these defaults:
 *
 * - `createdDate` sorted in `DESC` order
 * - `cursorPaging.limit` is `50`
 *
 * You can check the overview about all
 * [supported filters](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-bookings/bookings-reader-v2/supported-filters)
 * for more information.
 *
 * `query.fields` and `query.fieldsets` aren't supported for this endpoint.
 *
 * When using filters for dates, you must use [UTC time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time).
 *
 * Bookings belonging to a schedule don't have a `sessionId`. Therefore you
 * must use the `sessionId` filter that isn't part of the `query` object to
 * filter bookings for courses.
 *
 * To learn about working with _Query_ endpoints, see
 * [API Query Language](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/getting-started/api-query-language),
 * [Sorting and Paging](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/getting-started/sorting-and-paging),
 * and [Field Projection](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/getting-started/field-projection).
 *
 * When calling Query Bookings, the retrieved data may not contain your most recent changes. See
 * [Wix-data and Eventual Consistency](reference/wix-data/introduction#wix-data_introduction_wix-data-and-eventual-consistency)
 * for more information.
