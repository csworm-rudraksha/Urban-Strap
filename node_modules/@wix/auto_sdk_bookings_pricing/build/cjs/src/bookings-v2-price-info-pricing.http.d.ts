 * The previewed price is not the actual price that will be used to charge the customer.
 * `Preview Price` only estimates the base price by adding up the price
 * of each line item before
 * the booking is actually created.

 *
 * ## Calculating the previewed price
 *
 * Wix Bookings has its own default pricing logic for previewing the price. You must
 * pass the `serviceId` in the `slot`
 * or `schedule` object to `previewPrice()`.
 *
 * You cannot call `previewPrice()` if you have customized Bookings pricing logic using the
 * [BookingsCustomPricing](https://dev.wix.com/docs/velo/api-reference/wix-bookings-v2/service-plugins-spis/bookings-custom-pricing/introduction) service plugin. Calling `previewPrice` if custom pricing
 * logic has been implemented for the site results in an error.

 * Alternatively you can customize the pricing logic using the

 * If you integrate with a pricing provider, the customized pricing logic becomes
 * the default logic. This means that, if the Custom Pricing service plugin is implemented,
 * when calling `calculatePrice()`,
 * the customized logic is used instead.
