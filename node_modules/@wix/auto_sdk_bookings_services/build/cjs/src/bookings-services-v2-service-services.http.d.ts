/**
 * Creates a service.
 *
 *
 * ## Required fields
 *
 * When creating a service you must specify the following fields:
 * - `type`
 * ([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/services/about-service-types) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/services/services-v2/about-service-types)):
 * Whether it's an appointment-based service, class, or course.
 * - `name`: Service name that's displayed to customers.
 * - `onlineBooking`:
 * Settings determining whether customers can book online, whether the business
 * must manually confirm bookings, and whether customers can request to book an
 * appointment time slot that already has a booking request awaiting business
 * confirmation.
 * - `payment`
 * ([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/services/about-service-payments) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/services/services-v2/about-service-payments)):
 * How customers can pay when signing up for the service.
 *
 * ### Session durations
 *
 * Depending on which type of service you're creating, you may also need to specify
 * supported session durations.
 *
 * __Classes and courses__
 *
 * Don't specify `schedule.availabilityConstraints.sessionDurations`.
 *
 * __Appointment-based services without varied pricing based on session length__
 *
 * Specify the single supported session duration in the
 * `schedule.availabilityConstraints.sessionDurations` array.
 *
 * __Appointment-based services with varied pricing based on session length__
 *
 * - Specify all supported session durations in `schedule.availabilityConstraints.sessionDurations`.
 * - Note that Wix Bookings doesn't display these values to customers and
 * ignores them in pricing and availability calculations. Instead session
 * durations are retrieved from the relevant service *variants*
 * ([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/service-options-and-variants/introduction) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/services/service-options-and-variants/introduction)).
 * - It is mandatory to specify `schedule.availabilityConstraints.sessionDurations`,
 * even though these values are ignored.

 * Creates a query to retrieve a list of `service` objects.

 *
 * The returned object contains the query definition, which is typically used to run the query using the [find()](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/services/services-query-builder/find) function.
 *
 * You can refine the query by chaining `ServicesQueryBuilder` functions onto the query. `ServicesQueryBuilder` functions enable you to sort, filter, and control the results that `queryServices()` returns.
 *
 * `queryServices()` runs with the following `ServicesQueryBuilder` defaults that you can override:
 *
 * + `limit` is `100`.
 * + Sorted by `createdDate` in ascending order.
 *
 * The functions that are chained to `queryServices()` are applied in the order they are called. For example, if you apply `ascending("category.name")` and then `ascending("name")`, the results are sorted first by `category.name`, and then, if there are multiple results with the same `category.name`, the items are sorted by `name`.
 *
 * The following `ServicesQueryBuilder` functions are supported for the `queryServices()` function. For a full description of the `service` object, see the object returned for the [items](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/services/services-query-result/items) property in `ServicesQueryResult`.

 * able to provide access to the removed location in the future.

 * scheduled at the removed location, specify
 * `{"removedLocationSessionsAction.action": "MOVE_TO_LOCATION"}` and
 * `moveToLocationOptions.newLocation`.
 *
 * You can't mix and match to keep some sessions at the previous location while
 * moving other sessions to an updated location.
 *
 * Past session details aren't changed, no matter which option you choose for
 * future sessions.
 *
 * Future sessions scheduled for a location defined by the customer are also not
 * updated.
 *
 * ## Specify location details
 *

 * you need to specify different fields.

 * - **Business location**: Specify the relevant *location ID*
 * ([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/business-tools/locations/introduction) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-management/locations/introduction))
 * in `locations.business.id`.
 * - **Custom location**: Specify the complete address object as
 * `locations.custom.address`.
 *
 * ## Participant notifications
 *
 * You can specify a `participantNotification.message` that's immediately send
 * to all customers who had booked at a changed location. Ensure
 * `participantNotification.notifyParticipants` is set to `true` to send the
 * message.

 * to add them as needed.
 * - __For classes and courses__: Future one-time events aren't added to the
 * cloned service's schedule, while future recurring events are added
 * asynchronously. The *Clone Service* call always succeeds, whether or not
 * recurring events are added.
 * If the response includes `RECURRING_EVENTS` in the `errors` array, it means the

 * they're cloned asynchronously. The *Clone Service* call always succeeds,
 * regardless of whether variants were cloned.
 *
 * If the response includes `OPTIONS_AND_VARIANTS` in the `errors` array, the cloned
 * service doesn't have variants, even though the original service does. You can
 * delete the cloned service and call *Clone Service* again, or use the

 * ([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/service-options-and-variants/introduction) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/services/service-options-and-variants/introduction))
