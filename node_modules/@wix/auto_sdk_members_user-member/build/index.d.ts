     * Creates a query to retrieve a list of user members.
     *
     * The `queryUserMembers()` method builds a query to retrieve a list of user members and returns a [`UserMembersQueryBuilder`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/members/user-member/user-members-query-builder/ascending) object.
     *
     * The returned object contains the query definition, which is typically used to run the query using the [`find()`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/members/user-member/user-members-query-builder/find) method.
     *
     * You can refine the query by chaining `UserMembersQueryBuilder` methods onto the query. `UserMembersQueryBuilder` methods enable you to sort, filter, and control the results `queryUserMembers()` returns.
     *
     * `queryUserMembers()` runs with these `UserMembersQueryBuilder` defaults, which you can override:
     *
     * - [`limit(50)`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/members/user-member/user-members-query-builder/limit)
