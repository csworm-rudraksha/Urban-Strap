/**
 * Creates a query to retrieve a list of tax regions.
 *
 * The `queryTaxRegions()` function builds a query to retrieve a list of tax regions and returns a `TaxRegionsQueryBuilder` object.
 *
 * The returned object contains the query definition, which is typically used to run the query using the `find()` function.
 *
 * You can refine the query by chaining `TaxRegionsQueryBuilder` functions onto the query. `TaxRegionsQueryBuilder` functions enable you to sort, filter, and control the results that `queryTaxRegions()` returns.
 *
 * `queryTaxRegions()` runs with the following `TaxRegionsQueryBuilder` default that you can override:
 * + `ascending("_id")`
 *
 * The functions that are chained to `queryTaxRegions()` are applied in the order they are called. For example, if you apply `ascending("country")` and then `ascending("subdivision")`, the results are sorted first by the `"country"`, and then, if there are multiple results with the same `"country"`, the items are sorted by `"subdivision"`.
 *
 * The following `TaxRegionsQueryBuilder` functions are supported for the `queryTaxRegions()` function. For a full description of the tax region object, see the object returned for the `items` property in `TaxRegionsQueryResult`.
