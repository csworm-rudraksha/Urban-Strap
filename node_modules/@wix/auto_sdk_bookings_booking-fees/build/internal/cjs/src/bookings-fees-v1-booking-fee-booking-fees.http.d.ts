 * Retrieves booking fees by booking IDs.
 *
 *
 * Instead of returning `bookingFee` objects with the `cancellationFee.price.value`
 * set to `0.00`, the method doesn't return a `bookingFee` object for the relevant
 * booking IDs. For example, no `bookingFee` object is returned if the canceled
 * booking was free or if the booking was canceled before the start of the earliest
 * cancellation window with an associated fee.
 *
 * If the service's booking policy has been updated since the booking was created,
 * booking fees are calculated according to the *booking policy snapshot*
 * ([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/booking-policy-snapshots/introduction) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/policies/booking-policy-snapshots/introduction))
 * rather than the current version of the *policy*
 * ([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/booking-policies/introduction) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/bookings/policies/booking-policies/introduction)).
 *
 * This method calculates the cancellation fee amount based on the time of the
 * call, you can't specify a time. Similarly, it calculates the cancellation fee
 * based on the number of participants who canceled, not a provided number.
 *
 * A `cancellationFee.status` of `PREVIEW` indicates that the booking fee is
 * informational only; the customer isn't required to pay it. When the `status` is
 * set to `UNKNOWN_STATUS` there is no eCommerce order associated with the booking. For
 * example, if a custom checkout was used for the booking instead of the
 * _eCommerce checkout_
 * ([SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/ecom/checkout/setup) | [REST](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/business-solutions/e-commerce/checkout/introduction)).
 *
 * If multiple events would trigger the calculation of a booking fee, for example
 * when a booking is first canceled and then marked as not attended, Wix calculates
 * the booking fee based on the first trigger. In this example, the booking
 * cancellation.

 * price can't be higher than the sum of all booking fees.
 *
 * Apply Booking Fees to Order also updates the prices of all affected line items
 * in the relevant eCommerce order to zero. After a cancellation fee is applied
 * to an eCommerce order, the cancellation fee's `price.value` is updated to `0.00`
