     *
     * The returned object contains the query definition which is typically used to run the query using the [`find()`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/members/custom-field-suggestions/suggestions-query-builder/find) method.
     *
     * You can refine the query by chaining `SuggestionsQueryBuilder` methods onto the query. `SuggestionsQueryBuilder` methods enable you to sort, filter, and control the results that `queryCustomFieldSuggestions()` returns. The methods that are chained to `queryCustomFieldSuggestions()` are applied in the order they are called.
     *
     * `queryCustomFieldSuggestions()` runs with the following `SuggestionsQueryBuilder` defaults that you can override:
     * - [`skip`: `0`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/members/custom-field-suggestions/suggestions-query-builder/skip)
     * - [`limit`: `50`](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/members/custom-field-suggestions/suggestions-query-builder/limit)
