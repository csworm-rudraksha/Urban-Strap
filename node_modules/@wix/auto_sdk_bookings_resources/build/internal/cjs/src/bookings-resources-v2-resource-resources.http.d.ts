/**
 * Creates a query to retrieve a list of resources.

 * The `queryResources()` function builds a query to retrieve a list of resources and returns a `ResourcesQueryBuilder` object.
 *
 * The returned object contains the query definition, which is typically used to run the query using the [find()](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/resources/resources-query-builder/find) function.
 *
 * You can refine the query by chaining `ResourcesQueryBuilder` functions onto the query. `ResourcesQueryBuilder` functions enable you to sort, filter, and control the results that `queryResources()` returns.
 *
 * `queryResources()` runs with the following `ResourcesQueryBuilder` default that you can override:
 *
 * + `limit` is `50`.
 * + Sorted by `id` in ascending order.
 *
 * The functions that are chained to `queryResources()` are applied in the order they are called. For example, if you apply `ascending("typeId")` and then `ascending("name")`, the results are sorted first by the `"typeId"`, and then, if there are multiple results with the same `"typeId"`, the items are sorted by `"name"`.
 *
 * The following `ResourcesQueryBuilder` functions are supported for the `queryResources()` function. For a full description of the resource object, see the object returned for the [items](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/resources/resources-query-result/items) property in `ResourcesQueryResult`.
