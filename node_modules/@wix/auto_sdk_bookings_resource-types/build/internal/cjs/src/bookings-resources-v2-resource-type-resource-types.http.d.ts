/**
 * Creates a query to retrieve a list of resource types.
 *
 * The `queryResourceTypes()` function builds a query to retrieve a list of resource types and returns a `ResourceTypesQueryBuilder` object.
 *
 * The returned object contains the query definition, which is typically used to run the query using the [find()](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/resource-types/resource-types-query-builder/find) function.
 *
 * You can refine the query by chaining `ResourceTypesQueryBuilder` functions onto the query. `ResourceTypesQueryBuilder` functions enable you to sort, filter, and control the results that `queryResourceTypes()` returns.
 *
 * `queryResourceTypes()` runs with the following `ResourceTypesQueryBuilder` default that you can override:
 *
 * + `limit` is `50`.
 * + Sorted by `id` in ascending order.
 *
 * The functions that are chained to `queryResourceTypes()` are applied in the order they are called.
 *
 * The following `ResourceTypesQueryBuilder` functions are supported for the `queryResourceTypes()` function. For a full description of the resource object, see the object returned for the [items](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/backend-modules/bookings/resource-types/resource-types-query-result/items) property in `ResourceTypesQueryResult`.
